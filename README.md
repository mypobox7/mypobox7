# Hey! get to know Saurabh 


## Data, something I've worked on since my very early career days, and realized slowly in my path that combining IT skills and my experience with the Capital Market domain will help me understand the markets better. 
I am well versed in SQL, Python, BI tools, and MS Excel which helps me find crisp information out of unorganized data sets. Decision-making is a tough choice so I use my Data Analysis skills for a better understanding on the subjectivity keeping the core objective alive to increase the winning probability. 
That's the whole idea btw!
